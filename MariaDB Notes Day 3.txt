Create table Foo (

) ENGINE = InnoDB;

// File-Per_table

show engines

show create table Customer 
	// Shows existing statement 
	// fully filled out

alter table Foo engine = myEngine;
	// where myEngine is one of the available
	// options installed from 'show engines'

Our customer table is already XtraDB/InnoDB

Take a few minutes to 
Create another table (Orders) with Engine = Aria
	Put in a few records
ls -l the datadir/weasley
Alter table customer to use Aria
ls -l the datadir/weasley

cd /maria_runtime
mkdir raw
cd raw
wget http://nextgened.com/cvs/xmardba/data/weasleydb.mysql.dump

You can't use
/etc/init.d/mysql start
at the moment - it needs to be tweaked for our new data dir

Use
mysqld_safe &
instead for now.

mysqldump -u calvin -p weasley -S 
	/mariadb_runtime/run/mariadb.sock > 20160629@11.09.weasley.mysql.dump

Creates a hot logical dump (hot - while server is running, logical because it uses text format)
	Universal, but slow to restore

For a physical cold dump, we copy all the data and log files
	binlog - stores events in binary log - anything that modifies or potentially the data or its structure
		timestamped
		checkpoints
	undo log - in transaction log
	redo log - logs statements to be executed, removed after completion - for crash survival

	Fastest to backup, fastest to restore, but we have to down the server**
		(** - use a slave in master/slave config)

https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/log-files/

For a physical hot dump, we need to use the binlog and products that use it (XtraBackup, mysqlhotcopy)
	still give us the mariadb binary data files, indexes, logs, etc.
	Slows down the database server **
	Bit tricker and the backup itself takes significantly longer
		(** can also be done on a slave)


Take a quick minute to do the mysqldump above (substituting your userId) and look at the
	resulting file
Do that and then take a Break until noon Eastern


mysqldump defaults to full, integrated SQL (both DROP/CREATE statements and INSERT statements)

  mysqldump -u calvin -p weasley > 20160629@11.09.weasley.mysql.dump

This output can be piped into the mysql command client

  mysql -u calvin -p < 20160629@11.09.weasley.mysql.dump

mysqldump can also be used to output the data separately as CSV or tab-delimited 
(2 files-per-table, one for the SQL DROP/CREATE, one txt for the data):

	mysqldump -u calvin -p weasley -T .

mysqlimport can take those files and import them (usually significantly faster than SQL files)
By default, the text files need to be in the data/dbName dir

	mysql -u calvin -p weasley < *.sql
	mysqlimport -u calvin -p weasley *.txt

copy/paste
CONNECT engine (later)
	Connect for SQL Server
	Connect for Txt file
	Connection to Hive (as time allows)
DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY
aria_log
	undo logs - transaction commit/rollback
ibdata
ib_logfile (similar to Oracle redo)
	redo - commands to repair from restart (pre-flushed)
	binlogs
		(point-in-time recover, replication, clustering)
	rollover from 0-1

CVS: Keep iblogs/data in different folder from aria
	(ib_log_directory different from datadirectory)

In order to make copy and paste work:

In VirtualBox menu, Device->Network->Network Settings
Switch networking type from NAT to Bridged (which gives us DHCP (Dynamic)) on eth0/Adapter 1

In Linux
Restart the network
	/etc/init.d/network restart

Get the new DHCP address
	ifconfig eth0

ssh into the box
	(Run Command in windows, cmd, then ssh)
	ssh -l root 192.168.2.XX 
	(where XX is your likely new host IP)
