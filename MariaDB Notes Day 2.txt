Notes - Day 2

We'll get started in about 2 minutes. Waiting for some folks to finishing logging in.

Grab a quick cuppa.

Added a MariaDB.repo in /etc/yum.repos.d/
yum install MariaDB Server & Client
Optional up & down -grades
	(Not data and not config files)
	(Not the process - do a /etc/init.d/mysql stop, then backup, then test the backup, then the upgrade, then /etc/init.d/mysql start)

Up for today
	Files, log files, etc.
	Alternate installations
	Security (just a bit more)
	Backends (MyISAM, InnoDB, Aria, XtraDB, Memory, TokuDB, ScaleDB, ...)
	Backups / Cloning
	

cHARSETS (AT SOME POINT throughout the course)



Compiled installation (self-compiled from source)
	=> /usr/local/mysql
		.../bin = binary executables and scripts 
		.../logs = runtime logs
		.../data = all of your data, including caches
		.../lib = shared libraries (including plugins)
		.../conf | .../etc = your my.cnf file (but self-chosen)
		.../include = headers for compilation
		.../share | .../man = manual pages and support text files
		.../scripts 
		.../support-files = sample my.cnf files and more

Default "yum" installation:
	Special "configure" script customized version for RHEL/CentOS
		
		.../bin => /usr/bin
		.../logs => /var/lib/mysql
		.../data => /var/lib/mysql
		.../lib => /usr/lib/mysql or /usr/lib64/mysql depending on platform
		.../conf | .../etc = /etc/my.cnf (and /etc/my.cnf.d/ )
		.../include => /usr/include 
		.../share | .../man => /usr/share, /usr/share/man

	To alter yum-compiled-in defaults, either:
		modify my.cnf file 
		use command-line options
		modify the /etc/init.d/mysql script

	10.1.11
	10 -> Major version
	1 -> Minor version
	11 -> Patch level


	root -> /usr/bin/mysqld_safe ... (a wrapper to runas mysql)
		sudo as mysql user -> /usr/sbin/mysqld ...
		(originally executed from /etc/init.d/mysql start)
		(which is more easily invoked as "service start")

		(remember, we can do "/etc/init.d/mysql stop" == "service mysql stop"
			or "/etc/init.d/mysql restart" == "service mysql restart")

	Table names (and sometimes field names) may be case sensitive
	Depending on storage backend, filing system type, and config options!

	User & Host are a tuple (combination pair)
		calvin@localhost	password: foobar	(all privs)
		calvin@www.foo.com	password: barfoo	(restricted)
	treated as if they were two completely different users

		% = wildcard (good idea to not use this for hosts)
	
	
192.168.4.7
192.0.0.0 = 192.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 => address must start with 192
192.168.0.0 = 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0 => address must start with 192.168...

user@host
	host can be 

calvinvette @ %.cvs.com
calvinvette @ 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0
localhost == 127.0.0.1

create user 'testuser'@'%corp.cvs.com'
HOST and USER is Primary Key in the mysql.user table


appUser@192.168.4.11	password: foobar11
appUser@192.168.4.12	password: foobar12



Places to change compiled-in defaults:
/etc/init.d/mysql < my.cnf < command-line options


Migrate to a more "segregated" mysql data directory structure

1. Stop the mysql server
	service mysql stop

2. mkdir /mysql_runtime

3. Make a "data", "logs", and "run" directories in it
	cd /mysql_runtime
	mkdir data
	mkdir logs
	mkdir run

4. Move the data, log and pid files
	mv /var/lib/mysql/* data
	mv data/*.pid run
	mv data/*log* data/*.err logs

5. Change ownership to mysql user

	chown -R mysql:mysql /mysql_runtime

Take a quick break then do these steps until 12:45 Eastern - we'll
finish them off real quick then go to lunch. Sorry!
